# MobiusStrip


i defined the MobiusStrip Class firstly, 
and added the libraries which are important at the time of coding.
- numpy: For math and array operations.
- scipy.integrate.simps: Used to calculate surface area via numerical integration (Simpson’s rule).
- euclidean: Computes distances between 3D points.
- matplotlib: Used to draw the 3D Möbius strip plot.


it calculates its surface area, edge length, and visualizes it in 3D.
__init__ — Initialize the Strip

used following variables:
    R: Radius from the center of the loop to the strip.
    w: Width of the strip.
    n: Resolution (how many points we use to build the mesh).
    
and then in generate_mesh function :
Uses the parametric equation of a Möbius strip:-
        x(u,v)=(R+vcos(u/2))cos(u)
        y(u,v)=(R+vcos(u/2))sin(u)
        z(u,v)=vsin(u/2)

u (angle around the loop),
v (position across the strip width),
and produces 3D coordinates (X, Y, Z).

in the compute_surface_area Function following are the operations :
Compute partial derivatives (Xu, Xv, etc.) = change in shape across u and v.
Take the cross product of these to get surface patches.
Compute the magnitude (norm) of each patch = tiny area piece.
Use Simpson’s Rule to sum up the total area from all tiny pieces.

after computing the surface area we have to also calculate the edge so in compute_edge_length Function: 
Taking points along one side (v = +w/2),
Calculating distance between each pair of consecutive points,
Adding them all up using Euclidean distance.

and plot the 3D Möbius strip.
